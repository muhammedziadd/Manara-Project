# Serverless REST API with DynamoDP and API Gateway

## Project Overview

This project implements a fully serverless RESTful API for managing a simple to-do list (or customer records). The API allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations through HTTP endpoints, with all backend logic handled by AWS Lambda and data stored in DynamoDB. The architecture leverages various AWS services to create a scalable, maintainable, and secure solution.


## Architecture Overview

![Project Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/muhammedziadd/Manara-Project/blob/main/ManaraProject-ServerlessArchitecture.drawio.svg)

> Flow Summary:

- User accesses the web app via **app.todolist.com**
- **Route 53** resolves the domain to an **S3-hosted static website**
- The frontend (S3) sends HTTP requests to **API Gateway**
- **API Gateway** routes the requests to specific **Lambda functions**
- **Lambda functions** perform CRUD operations on **DynamoDB** that stors to-do items using
  a key-value/document data model
- **CloudWatch** captures logs and metrics from **Lambda executions**
- **IAM roles** securely manage permissions across all components

---

## Architecture Components

###  User Access via Custom Domain
- A user opens their web browser and navigates to app.todolist.com
- This domain is registered and managed via Amazon Route 53, which handles DNS resolution

###  Route 53
- Domain name registration and management
- Amazon Route 53 maps the domain (app.todolist.com) to the Amazon S3 bucket hosting the frontend
- The browser receives the static website content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from S3
- DNS routing policies (weighted, latency-based, geolocation)

### Amazon S3
- Static website hosting on Amazon S3
- The static frontend provides a user interface to interact with the to-do list
- Direct integration with API Gateway
- Responsive web interface for CRUD operations
- Secure access through HTTPS

### API Gateway
- Frontend Sends REST API Requests to API Gateway
- RESTful endpoints for all CRUD operations
- Request validation and transformation
- API versioning support
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting and throttling
- API Gateway exposes and manages the REST API, routing the requests to the appropriate backend services

### Lambda
- API Gateway Routes Requests to AWS Lambda
- Serverless functions for each CRUD operation
- Event-driven architecture
- Stateless environment
- Automatic scaling based on demand
- Only billed for the time they execute.

### DynamoDB
- Lambda functions interact with Amazon DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database for data persistence 
- NoSQL database for data persistence
- Flexible schema design
- DynamoDB ensures low-latency read/write performance and scales automatically with demand
- Support for both document and key-value data models
- Optimized for high-performance CRUD operations


## Monitoring and Logging

### CloudWatch
- All logs generated by the Lambda functions are sent to Amazon CloudWatch Logs
- Real-time monitoring
- Custom metrics and dashboards
- Log aggregation
- Automated alerting
- Performance metrics tracking
- Set alarms to notify on anomalies or failures


## Security Implementation

### AWS IAM
- IAM Roles are used to manage secure access between services:
    - Lambda Execution Role: Grants the Lambda functions permission to interact with DynamoDB and CloudWatch.
    - API Gateway Execution Role: Enables API Gateway to invoke the correct Lambda function.
    - S3 Bucket Policy: Controls who can access the frontend and from which domains (CORS).
- Role-based authentication
- Resource-based policies
- The system follows the Principle of Least Privilege
